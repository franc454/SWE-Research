# SWE-Research

This repository contains code to log data from the Ultimate GPS for the Arduino IDE.  Additionally, the plot_LWC folder contains python scripts that easily plot liquid water content vs time for data collected in a .txt file.  The data is collected in a .txt file by the combination of echo_with_signal_strength uploaded to an Arduino board and the RS232 Data Logger application by Eltima Software.

This project is based on the goal of discovering liquid water content for a given snowpack in order to better understand and predict stream discharge rates from snowmelt, avalanches and more.
