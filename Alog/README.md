I attempted to create an example script (GPS_with_Alog) and edit the Logger.h and Logger.cpp in order to log data to the SD card of the Alog Bottlelogger.  Unfortunately, I was unable to finish in time and the files in this folder are unable to log the data from the Ultimate GPS.  I have named the instances for the Ultimate GPS as 'UltimateGPS' in both Logger.h and Logger.cpp.  I will have to study C/C++ and the Alog Bottlelogger more in order to complete this section of the independent study.
